### June 2025

The Kite Project started in June 2025. Initially, kites were made with red
paper. The red kites hung up in rows begged the question, "what is your red line to end the genocide
in Palestine?"

Names and ages started off being written by hand. However, because of the relentless killing
of innocent children and their families by the IOF (Israeli Occupation Forces), writing names and ages by hand would take a lifetime.

With the help and support of <a href="https://neroink.net" target="_blank">Nero Ink</a>, we were able to create a design that included the 
names and ages of children between the ages of 0-18 years old. 

A message from Nero Ink: 

> "No, thank you. You had some of our visitors (and us) in tears. For me it was really important to print their names, and to dignify each one."
