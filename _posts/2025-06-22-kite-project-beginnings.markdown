The Kite Project started in June 2025. Initially, kites were made with red
paper begging the question, what is your red line to end the genocide
in Palestine. 

Names and ages were also going to be written by hand, but with the relentless killing
of innocent children by the IOF, writing names and ages by hand would take a lifetime.
