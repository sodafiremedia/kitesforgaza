The Community Kite Project for Gaza, a large-scale art project in Albuquerque, NM, invites community members in the creation of 21,907 small origami kites. Each kite bears the name and age of a child killed in Gaza from Oct 7, 2023-Sep 18, 2025. Grievously, this is not the  total number of children martyred by Israel's US-backed genocide against the Palestinians. 

The project was inspired by renowned Palestinian poet and literature professor Refaat Alareer's poem "[If I Must Die](./index.markdown)". Professor Alareer was tragically killed during the genocide along with several of his family members. 

This project raises funds for families via the [Among the Rubble Collective](https://www.instagram.com/amongtherubblecollective/), continues to bring awareness to the magnitude of this atrocity, and moreover, remembers and honors each child. 

Currently, the kite project has folded about 1,000 kites completed by dozens of community members. Every person who has participated in the project has been deeply moved by the process and intent of the project. We have engaged participants at public events across the city and have experienced overwhelming support. 

Because many of Gaza's institutions have been destroyed during the genocide, the kite project is looking for public institutions to display the kites. Eventually, images of the displayed kites across Albuquerque will be shown together with the kites in an exhibit yet to be determined.

Community members are welcome to help fold the kites for display. A suggested donation of $1/kite is asked but not required to participate. 

As we collectively continue to witness, and learn more, about the depth of Israel's war crimes, the Community Kite Project for Gaza intends to form a path towards healing and grieving together in order to continue the fight for Palestinian liberation.
