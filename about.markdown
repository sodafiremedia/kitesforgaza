The Community Kite Project for Gaza, a large-scale art project, invites community members in the creation of 21,907 small origami kites. Each kite bears the name and age of each child killed in Gaza from Oct 7, 2023-Sep 18, 2025. Grievously, this is not the  total number of children martyred by Israel's US-backed genocide against the Palestinians. 

This project raises funds for families via the Among the Rubble Collective, continues to bring awareness to the magnitude of this atrocity, and moreover, remembers and honors each child. 

Community members are welcome to help fold the kites for display. A suggested donation of $1/kite is asked but not required to participate. 

As we collectively continue to witness, and learn more, about the depth of Israel's crimes, the Community Kite Project for Gaza intends to form a path towards healing and grieving together in order to continue the fight for Palestinian liberation.

Contact [pawswipe@protonmail.com](mailto:pawswipe@protonmail.com) for more information or to invite the project to your next event.
